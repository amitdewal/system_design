What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?

Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP) states that the “objects of a superclass should be
replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application”.

That means, if class B is a subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace objects of A with B without
breaking the behaviour of the program. Subclass should extend the capability of the parent class, not narrow it
down.
