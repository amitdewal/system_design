What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)?

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that “high-level components should not
depend on low-level components directly; instead, they should depend on abstractions”.
In other words, classes should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes. 
Additionally, abstractions should
not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
