What is the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that “clients should not be forced to depend on
interfaces they don't use. Instead of having one large interface with many methods, 
it'sbetter to have multiple smaller, focused interfaces”.
 That means, Interfaces should be such that the client should NOT implement unnecessary functions they do not
need.
