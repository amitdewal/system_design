Definition
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines multiple algorithms,
encapsulates their logic in dedicated classes, and enables changing an algorithm's
behavior at runtime. It's particularly useful when you have multiple ways to perform a task
and want to choose the approach dynamically.

Popular Real-life Examples
Courier Service → Shipping Cost Calculation - Discount for Premium members, Flat fee, Distance-based based
and weight-based computations.
Shopping Cart → Payment Options - CrediCard, PayPal, UPI, Cash, etc.

Vehicle Manufacturing → Different cars(like SUVs, EVs, etc) require different drive modes.
Problems without Strategy Pattern
Refer Strategy Pattern | Implementation section below for a better understanding.
1. Massive Conditional Blocks leading to bloated classes
2. Violation of the Open/Closed Principle and Single Responsibility Violation
3. Code Duplication
4. Tight Coupling
5. Testing Complexity
